## THIS PART IS DEDICATED TO FIRST API TEST OF PREPARED APPLICATION

#### GET Methods - firs example only - all content is in folder *Practical_Part --> Postman_Conf --> Postman_Structure.js*

**1. Ask for users:**

**Method:** GET

**Endpoint:** https://olive-nasal-game.glitch.me/api/users

### *Postman Structure Preparation And Simple Configuration Plus Environments usage*

Building the structure we need to remember about good practice:
1. Collections names are respnsible for specific data retrieval (Eg: if we want to retrieve data for users it is good to name collection as ***Users***)
2. For specific data of users - if more than one api is engaged for retrieving data use separate folders/collections (if Collection is choosen then all other modules should be created in separate folders for better ordering)
3. Naming standards should be kept for all of the requests/collections in the structure

### What to remeber?

1. Every modification in request must be saved (If we want to - The dot in place of closing tab is displayed)
2. Every Request/Collection name modification is saved Automatically

### Environments in Postman

Environments in postman are used for parametrization of endpoints - for making them more efficient

#### Environment Creation is simple:

1. Add Environments tab in the side menu
2. Press the *Environments* tab
3. If first time press Create Environment, name it and add the:
    - Variable name: any but remember that name should be adequate to the action
    - Type - leave devault (secret will be explained later)
    - Initial value - is the value which should be assigned for the variable (eg: *https://olive-nasal-game.glitch.me/api*)
    - Current value - is attached automatically when clickec - is the same value as in initil values (used for safety reason)
4. From the *No Environment* Dropdown menu chose the name for environment  
5. Save the changes (The check icon will be added to the list of Environments created)
6. Use the Environment variable in Request Endpoint as all variables ***{{<env_name>}}***

#### !!! Remember that The Environment can be *exported* (... menu --> Export) and saved as file which can be later *Imported* with collection file to Postman tool
