## THIS FILE IS DEDICATED TO RESOURCES CREATION (POST METHOD) AND DYNAMIC PARAMETRIZATION

##### User Creation:
To create any resource it is good practice to use POST Method
Method: POST
Endpoint: *https://olive-nasal-game.glitch.me/api/:resource* where :resource == users
### Steps:
1. Prepare Endpoint and Set proper method in Postman
2. Add Request body - as following (**example only**):
```
{
  "email": "beauty@example.com",
  "firstname": "Johny",
  "lastname": "Bravo",
  "password": "myStrongPassword",
  "avatar": "face_1591133060.68834.jpg"
}
```
3. We can add status test - for creation the status is mostly 201 so we can add such a part of code inside the body tab
```
pm.test('should have status code 201', () => {
    pm.response.to.have.status(201);
});
```
4. Send the request and verify the response body (*example only*):
```
{
    "email": "beauty@example.com",
    "firstname": "Johny",
    "lastname": "Bravo",
    "password": "myStrongPassword",
    "avatar": "face_1591133060.68834.jpg",
    "id": 12
}
```
5. And verify status code is 201
6. Very Good

### Random data generated by Postman
Postman allows user to use variables for random generated data in Request body.
To use such a variables we need to add in such a way {{$<variable_name>}} - where *variable_name* is hinted via Postman itself
