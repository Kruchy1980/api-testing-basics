##### Customized Variables used in Postman
1. Locall variables --> pm.variables... (can be used only for request)
**pm.variables.set('localVariable', 1)**
2. Collection variable customized pm.colletionVariables... (can be used in the specific collection)
**pm.collectionVariables.set('collectionVariable', 2)**
3. Environments --> added in Section_4 .md file (can be used globally) !!!! The environment must be chosen when we want to use the Environment variable
**pm.environment.get("api_url")**
