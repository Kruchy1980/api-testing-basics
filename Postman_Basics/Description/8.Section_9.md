## THIS PART IS DEDICATED TO DELETE METHOD in Postman

### Good Practic
1. After deletion of specific usef find out whether delete it once more works properly
User not Found should be displayed wit Error code 404

##### Customized Variables used in Postman
1. Locall variables --> pm.variables... (can be used only for request)
**pm.variables.set('localVariable', 1)**
2. Collection variable customized pm.colletionVariables... (can be used in the specific collection)
**pm.collectionVariables.set('collectionVariable', 2)**
3. Environments --> added in Section_4 .md file (can be used in specific environment) !!!! The environment must be chosen when we want to use the Environment variable
**pm.environment.get("api_url")**
4. Global variable --> accessed globally in Postman
**pm.environment.get("globalVariable")**
5. Data variables --> come from external CSV and JSON files to define data sets you can use when running collections with *Newman* or the *Collection Runner*. Data variables have current values, which don't persist beyond request or collection runs.

#### VARIABLES HOSTING
1. Global --> can be overwritten by any of the variables
2. Collection --> can be overwritten by collection variable and lower
3. Environment variable --> can be overwritten by itself and lower
4. Data variable --> can be overwritten by itself and lower
5. Local variable --> can be overwritten by itself aonly
