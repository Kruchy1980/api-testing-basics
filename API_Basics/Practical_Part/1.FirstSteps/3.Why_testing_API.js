// THIS PART ANSWERS THE QUESTION WHY SHALL WE TEST API
/* The main reasons why to test API's:
Couple explanation words:
API tests are focused on Business logic - it means that they are veryfies functionality so are focusing on how something works not how something looks like
== Reasons to test API:
1. Functional tests - UNIT and INTEGRATION
2. Much faster finds the bugs what eqals lesser cost of App development - more cases can be tested on API than on GUI
3. Tests Backend for the following results:
    * Efficiency
    * Security/Safety
    * Correctivity of received data
=========== Benefits/Advantages of API Testing
1. API Tests are much faster than GUI Tests
2. Generates lesser cost and are easier in MAINTTENANCE
3. Can Speeds up the GUI Tests
4. Can be written and executed earlier than GUI tests
5. Are inedependent of tech Stack an Language (including programming language)
============ Disadvantages of API Testing:
1. Sometimes can be more expensive (costs includes mostly Time of: documentation knowledge, tools needed to API testing, tests preparation (order is important))
2. Can be harder to be implemented than GUI Tests
3. Do not verifies interaction USER <--> GUI
4. Sometimes not every functionality can be tested via API only
